Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib. The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with measurements of four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into how these features vary across the three species of iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Objectives

The key objectives of this exploratory data analysis are:

To visualize and explore the relationships between the features of the dataset.
To discover patterns and correlations between these features.
To identify which features are most useful for distinguishing between the three species of iris flowers.
To engineer a new feature to provide additional insights into species classification.
