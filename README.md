# Datafun-06 EDA Project

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Steps so far:
- Created a GitHub repository.
- Cloned the repository to my local machine.
- Set up a `.gitignore` file to ignore unnecessary files and folders.

## Dataset Information
The dataset chosen for this project is the **Iris Dataset**, which is pre-installed in Seaborn. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 5 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.
